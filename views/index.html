            <h2>Our Solar System</h2>
            <p>Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity â€” the planets 
            Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, dwarf planets such as Pluto, 
            dozens of moons and millions of asteroids, comets and meteoroids. Beyond our own solar system, 
            we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way.
            As well there are other solar systems who might contain earth like planets.</p>
            <h3>Why is it called "Solar" System?</h3>
            <p>There are many planetary systems like ours in the universe, with planets orbiting a host star. 
            Our planetary system is named the "solar" system because our Sun is named Sol, after the Latin word for Sun, 
            "solis," and anything related to the Sun we call "solar."</p>
